# PrisonEscape
Old project for one of my coding classes

Found this on one of my old USB sticks, so decided to upload it here.

I made another text adventure for another class project but unfortunaltly I didn't save it lol

# Download
No need to compile as a debug version is available [here](https://github.com/SnakieJakie/PrisonEscape/tree/main/PrisonEscape/bin/Debug)

I got a 100%, in case you were wondering. Also, miss Denton. If you're reading this, you're a fucking goated teacher :)
